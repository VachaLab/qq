    Entrypoint for executing a script inside the qq batch environment.

    - Ensures the script is running in a batch job context
    - Prepares the job working directory (scratch or shared)
    - Executes the script and handles exit codes
    - Logs errors or unexpected failures into the qq info file

    Note that the 'script_path' provided here is ignored.
    That's because the batch system provides only a temporary
    copy of the job. The original script copied to the working directory
    is used instead.

    Exits:
        Exits with the script's exit code, or with specific
        error codes:
            90: Script not being run inside a qq environment.
            91: Failed with a standard qq error logged into an info file.
            92: Fatal error not logged into an info file.
            93: Job killed without qq run being notified.
            99: Fatal unexpected error (indicates a bug).

        In case the execution is terminated by SIGTERM or SIGKILL,
        a specific value of the exit code cannot be guaranteed
        because it is typically set by the batch system itself
        (PBS uses 256 + signal number).

"""
Provides node presentation utilities.

This module organizes and formats information about compute nodes as reported by
the batch system, preparing it for human-readable terminal output.

Internal grouping logic clusters nodes with similar naming patterns, extracts
shared attributes, and aggregates resource and property data. These groups are
then rendered by `NodesPresenter`, which produces a unified panel showing node
availability, CPU/GPU capacities, scratch resources, and other relevant metrics.

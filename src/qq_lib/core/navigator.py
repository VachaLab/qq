"""
Navigation utilities for qq job directories.

This module defines the `Navigator` class, an extension of `Operator` that
locates a job's working directory and execution host. It provides helpers for
determining job destination, checking whether the current process is already in
the working directory, and inspecting job state in the context of directory navigation.

"""
Core implementation of the qq command-line tool.

This package provides the internal logic behind qq's job-submission and
job-management workflow. It defines the abstractions for batch systems, concrete
backends (PBS, Slurm, and site-specific variants), utilities for preparing and
synchronizing working directories, loop-job handling, and helpers for inspecting
jobs, queues, and nodes. All qq CLI commands ultimately delegate to the
functionality implemented here.

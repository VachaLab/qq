Termination utilities for qq jobs.

This module defines the `Killer` class, which extends `Operator` to validate
whether a job can be terminated and to invoke the batch system's kill command.

It also updates and locks the qq info file when appropriate, ensuring that killed jobs
are consistently recorded.

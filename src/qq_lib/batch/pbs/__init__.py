"""
PBS backend for qq: job submission, monitoring, and cluster-resource access.

This module implements qq's full integration with the PBS Pro batch system
as configured on the Metacentrum-family clusters.

It provides:

- The `PBS` batch-system backend, implementing job submission, killing, file
  synchronization (local and remote), work-directory handling, resource
  translation, dependency formatting, and scratch-directory logic.

- `PBSJob`, `PBSNode`, and `PBSQueue`, concrete implementations of qq's
  job/node/queue interfaces, responsible for parsing PBS command output and
  exposing normalized metadata to the rest of qq.

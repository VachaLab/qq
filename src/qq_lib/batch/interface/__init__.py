"""
Abstractions for integrating qq with HPC batch scheduling systems.

This module defines the core interfaces that allow qq to interact with
multiple batch systems through a unified API. It provides:

- `BatchInterface`: the central abstract interface that every batch-system
  backend implements. It defines operations such as job submission, job
  querying, directory synchronization, remote file access, resubmission, and
  navigation to compute nodes.

- `BatchJobInterface`, `BatchNodeInterface`, and `BatchQueueInterface`:
  lightweight abstractions representing jobs, nodes, and queues as reported
  by the underlying scheduler. These interfaces expose normalized metadata
  and allow qq to present consistent job/queue/node information regardless
  of scheduler differences.

- `BatchMeta`: a metaclass that registers available batch-system backends
  and provides mechanisms for selecting one from environment variables or by
  probing system availability. The `@batch_system` decorator registers
  implementations automatically.

"""
Slurm backend for qq: job submission, monitoring, and cluster-resource access.

This module implements qq's full integration with the Slurm batch system.

It provides:

- The `Slurm` batch-system backend, implementing job submission, killing,
  remote file access and synchronization, resource translation, dependency formatting,
  and all Slurm-specific environment propagation.

- `SlurmJob`, `SlurmNode`, and `SlurmQueue`, concrete implementations of qq's
  job/node/queue interfaces, responsible for parsing Slurm command output and exposing
  normalized metadata to the rest of qq.
